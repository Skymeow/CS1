# list has order, can container all data type, mixed type
# dictionary is not in order, like coatcheck
# in python list, it's all over the place, linked, first-(pointer)-second,in python only has list, no arr
# for arr, it has vector, memory, every item is one sized, some_list[0]
# sublets_of_items= list[:-1,-3]
# list[::2], start:end:steplength(slt.spliip 2 from start to end)
# # for the strings:
# shouldnt_be_famous = "nicholas cage"
# first_letter = shouldnt_be_famous[0]
# shouldnt_be_famous[::2]: give me every two letters
# # split method:separate the string by space,caz everything is an object in python, the string here is also an object
# split_up = list.split(" ")
# # install ipython
# some_list = [1,2,3,4,5."Hi"]
# msg = "Hi"
# check if sth exist in some_list
# if msg in some_list:
#     print("yes")
